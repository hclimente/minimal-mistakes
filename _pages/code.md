## Projects

### [smartas](https://bitbucket.org/regulatorygenomicsupf/smartas/src)

Evaluate the impact of alternative splicing in cancer. We conducted an analysis (available [here](https://github.com/hclimente/smartas)) on the TCGA dataset.

### [gin](https://github.com/hclimente/gin)

Leverage on biological networks to extract more information from GWAS. Based on [@dominikgrimm](https://github.com/dominikgrimm)'s implementation of [SConES](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/13/i171/198210/Efficient-network-guided-multi-locus-association). Under active development.

## R libraries

### [ggstars](https://github.com/hclimente/ggstars)

Adding significance symbols to ggplots was never so easy. ggstars draws an asterisk and a bracket over user-specified significant comparisons. Supports barplots and boxplots.

### [martini](https://github.com/hclimente/martini)

An R interface for gin, and other components of the scones2 GWAS suite. Under active development.

### [find.me](https://github.com/hclimente/find.me)

Explore mutual exclusion patterns in mutational data with ease.
